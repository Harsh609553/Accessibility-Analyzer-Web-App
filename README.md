# Accessibility Analyzer Web App

This project is a simple Accessibility Analyzer built to evaluate websites
for accessibility issues faced by users with disabilities.

The tool analyzes websites using automated accessibility testing
and highlights common problems such as missing alt text,
keyboard navigation issues, and poor color contrast.

This project was created as a hands-on learning exercise to understand
real-world web accessibility challenges and how automated tools
can help improve inclusive web design.
